# Image Upscaling with Deep Learning

### What is the RealESRGAN ?
<p>
  RealESRGAN is a practical algorithm for general image and video restoration. It is an extension of the powerful ESRGAN that synthesizes training pairs with a more realistic degradation mechanism to recover general real-world low-resolution images. RealESRGAN is able to enhance details while removing annoying artifacts for common real-world images, making it more useful in real-world applications.
